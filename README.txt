Our project is broken into two directories:

app/ has all of the files for our project. The HTML files are in app/, all of our CSS files are in app/stylesheets, and our JavaScript files are in app/scripts.

docs/ has all of our documentation. It includes our development document, our overview text, our screenshots, our user manual, and our video.
