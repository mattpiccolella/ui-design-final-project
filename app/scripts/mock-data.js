From musical groups performing to yoga classes.\n\nLocated in the heart of New York University 'campus' and Greenwich Village this is a great place to people watch or just read a book. The water fountain and iconic arch transports you to a French inspired neighborhood. Great vibe, could have hung out all day.","time":1470658215}],"scope":"GOOGLE","types":["park","point_of_interest","establishment"],"url":"https://maps.google.com/?cid=18041805897612033560","utc_offset":-300,"vicinity":"New York","website":"http://www.nycgovparks.org/parks/washingtonsquarepark","html_attributions":[]}

Early on you may not even be searched if you don't have a bag. Later, when there's lots of people coming in, you can have a full and thorough pat-down. A man searched with his bare hands through a friend's loose-tobacco-pouch (extremely thorough) because we were coming in right before Cashmere Cat went on, along with everyone else.\n\nOften, this will be the only venue that a band plays when they come to town.

The line that wrapped around the hallway, up two flights of stairs, and outside on the roof in the month of December..with no coat. The only reason I'm so annoyed by this is because no one informs you of this procedure and then the employees do nothing but berate and insult you as if you chose your own coat check fate. Maybe they wouldn't be so angry if everyone was made aware of this nonsense.
