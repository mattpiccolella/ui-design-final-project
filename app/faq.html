                	<li><b>Who is DayTrippr designed for?</b></li>
                	DayTrippr is designed for both the curious tourist who is interested in exploring new locations and for the saavy user interested in sharing his or her favorite trips and finding new, unexpected ones. The site lists a collection of day trips you can partake in during your time in New York City! 
                    <li><b>How do I use DayTrippr?</b></li>
                    If you are looking for something fun to do in the city, you can search through a collection of itineraries to find the one that is right for you. If you've had a really fun day in New York City recently or if you have a favorite day that you like to share, create the trip and let other explorers know about it! 
                    <li><b>What is a day trip?</b></li>
                    A day trip is a collection of places that you can go to in a single day. Often this includes a collection of different types of things. For example, in a single day you may go to a museum, then to a park, then a restaurant, and finally a show.
                	<li><b>How do I create a trip?</b></li>
                	Simply first look up places of interest. You'll be able to see details about each of these places, including photos, hours of operation, website, etc. Once you know a place looks interesting, add it to a list. Give it a title so that others know what to expect. When the list is completed, simply click create trip and your itinerary will be added to the collection.
                	<li><b>What does the route on Google Maps show?</b></li>
                	The map shows a suggested route of places listed in a day trip's itinerary. It provides simple walking directions from place to place.
                    <li><b>Can I search through trips?</b></li>
                    Yes! Simply type in what you are interested in and the app will list the trips that match your interests. You can search either by place name (e.g. The Guggenheim), place type (e.g. park), or trip title (e.g. bar crawl). DayTrippr will show all the results that match at least one of the three criteria.
